	<h1>Bootstrap Carousel Plugin</h1>
	<h2>The Carousel Plugin</h2>
	<p>The Carousel plugin is a component for cycling through elements, like a carousel (slideshow).</p>
	<h2>Example Explained</h2>
	<p><b>The outermost <div>:</b></p>
	<p>Carousels require the use of an id (in this case id="myCarousel") for carousel controls to function properly.</p>The class="carousel" specifies that this <div> contains a carousel.
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>The .slide class adds a CSS transition and animation effect, which makes the items slide when showing a new item. Omit this class if you do not want this effect.</p>
	<p>The data-ride="carousel" attribute tells Bootstrap to begin animating the carousel immediately when the page loads.</p>
	<h4>The "Indicators" part:</h4>
	<p>The indicators are the little dots at the bottom of each slide (which indicates how many slides there are in the carousel, and which slide the user is currently viewing).</p>
	<p>The indicators are specified in an ordered list with class .carousel-indicators.<br>The data-target attribute points to the id of the carousel.<br>The data-slide-to attribute specifies which slide to go to, when clicking on the specific dot.</p>
